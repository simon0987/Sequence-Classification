Quick & courteous ! Got a replacement key for my car for less than dealer . Open on the weekend :)
Out of all the Pho chains i 've tried , this has been the worst i 've had . Their Pho 's are relatively more pricey and yet the selection is n't that great . Their food is average and not memorable . They 're also quite stingy in their servings , my beef balls were tiny and few in numbers when i ordered beef noodle soup with beef balls . I would recommend going to 88 or Train instead if you 're looking for Pho .
I 've had some delicious Mexican food here in Phoenix . But this place trumps all . A stocked salsa bar , delicious fish tacos . Seriously , what is n't good here ? I 'm going to keep going here and trying a different menu item every time just to see if something is subpar here . I 'll put my savings on it that there is n't a single thing that is n't good here . I 'd probably go here just for the chips and salsa if Mexican food is n't your thing , but your coworker or spouse or some guy or girl you 're going on a date with insists on La Santisima . Just go . No excuses . Nothing . And order the chips and salsa . Try every salsa . I do n't care how strange pecan salsa or strawberry salsa sounds ... trust me , it wo n't disappoint .
The service started slow , but then was very attentive . My order came out and the steak was not hot . They fixed the problem right away . However , the quality of the food was mediocre . Okay if you are staying next door at the Sheraton ( which I was ) for convenience , but i would n't go out of my way .
First , please install purse hooks under the lovely bar . Second , check the prices ; bar food is slightly too high ! One can go to upscale Postino Wine Bar in Kierland & have panini & ciabatta for $ 10 . Nearby Brisam 's has gr8 burgers for $ 10 . Few of us need an 8 oz burger . Staff is friendly & professional . We want you to make it , but you need some ( healthy ) adjustments ( broccoli ? ) .
I have had nothing but amazing treats and drinks from this establishment . Service is amazing and the space beautifully reflects the King West vibe .
This place is a joke . Whatever you do do n't pay extra for feta cheese cuz you wo n't get it lol ! 2nd time this has happened . 1st time , okay I understand but 2nd time now your just making free $ $ . Asked for my gyro with feta cheese , tomatoes & lettuce . Lettuce went missing too ! My asst . Ordered a chicken pita & there was 4 very small pieces dried up pieces of chicken . I called to today to let them know they needed to pick up the pace & not rip people off with feta cheese , & lack of lettuce and lack of chicken of my assts lunch . But the owner answered and told me to speak with the person who made the lunches ! ! Are you kidding me ? What owner puts their cook on the phone ? A lazy one ! ! Yes , the cook messed up but to put the cook on the phone to handle the situation ? ! The cook even said it was unprofessional of the owner to put him on the phone . So , you will not get feta , lettuce , decent chicken or a answer from management / owner .. But the cook is forced to talk with angry customers ! Lol ! What a joke !
We found SCADDABUSH to be a large trendy restaurant with a cozy atmosphere . The employees were nothing but smiling , friendly , and provided great service ! The food is traditional Italian and got something for everyone , they produce their own mozarella and pasta , and tastes amazing .
By far the best spray tan I have ever gotten ; Susan is amazing ! ! My friend and I needed a last minute spray tan before jetting off on vacation , and called Susan . Within 30 minutes , Susan came back to the shop and spray tanned us both . The tan looked amazing , and lasted for over a week . She adjusted the shades for each of us , so neither of us looked orange or scary . She made us feel very comfortable , and her prices are very reasonable ! ! 10/10 would go again ! !
The store itself is a little run down with food and drink selections that are limited compared to the other quick stop shops in the area . The people are always nice and it has good hours that make it convenient for me to stop by , as I live right around the block from it . Not a bad place to pick up a quick drink or snack , but I try not to be there too often .
Wow what an amazing time I had this past weekend going down the the Salt River with friends . We were their for Memorial Day weekend and this place was packed . The whole river was filled with tubers , kayaks , swimmers , and just people on the banks having a picnic lunch and enjoying the water . We had our own rafts so we decided to pay the $ 8 for the park passes to park our car and just fill up our tubes and go . This was nice . We filled up our tubes , parked one car at the top and one at the bottom of the tube trip and went out on the water . At several different times because of wind we went backwards and or did not move at all . The total float took about 4 hours to complete . One thing I do wish is that they would have paved the area from the river to the road when you are waling your tube either to enter the river or to exit the river . Make sure to bring flip flops to walk on the bottom of the river , sun screen to protect from the sun , and lots of cold beers and snacks to enjoy down the river . Also ! Please do not toss your trash in the river . If you drop something please clean it out ! We found so many cans at the bottom of the river and other items . Lets keep the river clean for people years to come ! Have a great time going down the river and I ca n't wait to go back and do it again !
When my 2 year old dog started having seizures I was nervous to bring him ; he had never been to a vet and I was worried not just for him , but over the possibility that I would be ridiculed for never bring him to a vet . Everyone here was so sweet and welcoming ! They accept Care Credit , which was important to us since we knew that we could be on an expensive path dealing with our dogs seizures . They even offer an affordable monthly pet plan to help cover the costs of shots , check ups , etc . I 'm so glad I decided to bring our pup to the Alta Mesa Animal Hospital !
Jansen was awesome ! ! We bought and sold with him ! ! He sold our home in less than 12 hours ! ! ! And took me all over to see endless properties ! ! ! Great guy ! ! ! 100 % recommend ! ! ! !
Big big selection of beers , appetizers and sandwiches . I had the wild raspberry beer from Colorado , it was very good . When we arrived on a Saturday for lunch it was packed ! My party really enjoyed their chicken wings , I believe they just ordered original . The perogies were also tasty ; tender pockets of potato y goodness . I had the veggie sub with grilled green peppers , onions and black olives , prov cheese and french fries . Definitely was my first time having fries on a sandwich . It tasted like a cheesesteak sans the meat , pretty good . The sandwiches are HUGE though and come with either fries or potato chips . You 'd be best off sharing one of these bad boys . The soups were good , as was the soft pretzel and one of the chicken sandwiches . My aunt did not enjoy the Tuna Steak sandwich so I guess avoid that . Service was relatively slow and was the biggest negative for this place . We waited quite a while for our food to come out while other tables were being served . We also did not get as much attention as I would have liked from our waitress , we were a large crowd of 7 .
I would not shop here again . Went in to store to see clearance items . After arriving there I received typical experience of shopping while you are black . Salesclerk got tip on her walkie talkie to follow us to the rear of the store in the clearance section . Glad I did n't buy anything .
